# When gvim is maximized, it uses as much space as possible. If (dimension
# modulo block size) != 0, gtk fills with a default color. In my case, it was
# white.
#
# This fix "hides" the white fill by setting it to gvim's background color.
# Since I use Monokai, I've used the Monokai background color.
